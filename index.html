            <h2>Why Tree Service is Essential for Your Landscape</h2>
            <p>Trees, while beautiful and beneficial, require regular care to ensure they grow strong and healthy. Neglecting tree maintenance can lead to various problems, from overgrown branches that pose a hazard to diseased trees that can affect your entire yard.

Overgrown branches can block sunlight, damage property, or even interfere with power lines. Additionally, dead branches can harbor pests and diseases that can spread to healthy parts of the tree or nearby plants.</p>
